                Introduction to Java
            </header>
            <p>
                JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year
                1995, later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming
                language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy.
                It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java is a
                class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to
                have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose
                programming language made for developers to write once run anywhere that
                is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java. Java
                applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual
                Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.

            <header>History</header>
            <p>Java's history is very interesting. It is a programming language created
                in 1991. James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of
                Sun engineers known as the Green team initiated the Java language in
                1991. Sun Microsystems released its first public implementation in 1996
                as Java 1.0. It provides no-cost -run-times on popular platforms.
                Java1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur Van Hoff to strictly
                comply with its specifications. With the arrival of Java 2, new versions
                had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.<br>
                <br>In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO standards body and later
                formalized Java, but it soon withdrew from the process. At one time, Sun
                made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite
                their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java
                through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the
                Java Enterprise System. On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its
                Java virtual machine as free, open-source software. On May 8, 2007, Sun
                finished the process, making all of its JVM's core code available under
                open-source distribution terms.The principles for creating java were
                simple, robust, secured, high performance, portable, multi-threaded,
                interpreted, dynamic, etc. In 1995 Java was developed by James Gosling,
                who is known as the Father of Java. Currently, Java is used in mobile
                devices, internet programming, games, e-business, etc.

            <header>Java programming language is named JAVA. Why?</header>
            <p>After the name OAK, the team decided to give a new name to it and the
                suggested words were Silk, Jolt, revolutionary, DNA, dynamic, etc. These
                all names were easy to spell and fun to say, but they all wanted the
                name to reflect the essence of technology. In accordance with James
                Gosling, Java the among the top names along with Silk, and since java
                was a unique name so most of them preferred it. Java is the name of an
                island in Indonesia where the first coffee(named java coffee) was
                produced. And this name was chosen by James Gosling while having coffee
                near his office. Note that Java is just a name, not an acronym.</p>

            <header>Java Terminology</header>
            <p>Before learning Java, one must be familiar with these common terms of
                Java.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Java Virtual Machine(JVM):This is generally referred to as JVM.
                    There are three execution phases of a program. They are written,
                    compile and run the program.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Writing a program is done by a java programmer like you and me.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The compilation is done by the JAVAC compiler which is a primary
                            Java compiler included in the Java development kit (JDK). It takes
                            the Java program as input and generates bytecode as output.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In the Running phase of a program, JVM executes the bytecode
                            generated by the compiler.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <p>Now, we understood that the function of Java Virtual Machine is to
                    execute the byte-code produced by the compiler. Every Operating System
                    has a different JVM but the output they produce after the execution of
                    bytecode is the same across all the operating systems. This is why Java
                    is known as a platform-independent language.</p>
                <li>
                    Bytecode in the Development process:As discussed, the Javac
                    compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into bytecode so that it
                    can be executed by JVM. It is saved as .class file by the compiler. To
                    view the bytecode, a disassembler like javap can be used.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Java Development Kit(JDK):While we were using the term JDK when
                    we learn about bytecode and JVM. So, as the name suggests, it is a
                    complete Java development kit that includes everything including
                    compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), java debuggers, java docs,
                    etc. For the program to execute in java, we need to install JDK on our
                    computer in order to create, compile and run the java program.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Java Runtime Environment (JRE):JDK includes JRE. JRE
                    installation on our computers allows the java program to run, however,
                    we cannot compile it. JRE includes a browser, JVM, applet supports,
                    and plugins. For running the java program, a computer needs JRE.
                </li>
                <li>Garbage Collector:In Java, programmers can't delete the objects.
                    To delete or recollect that memory JVM has a program called Garbage
                    Collector. Garbage Collectors can recollect the objects that are not
                    referenced. So Java makes the life of a programmer easy by handling
                    memory management. However, programmers should be careful about their
                    code whether they are using objects that have been used for a long
                    time. Because Garbage cannot recover the memory of objects being
                    referenced.</li>
                <li>
                    ClassPath:The classpath is the file path where the java runtime
                    and Java compiler look for .class files to load. By default, JDK
                    provides many libraries. If you want to include external libraries
                    they should be added to the classpath.
                </li>

                Primary/Main Features of Java
            </header>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Platform Independent:Compiler converts source code to bytecode
                    and then the JVM executes the bytecode generated by the compiler. This
                    bytecode can run on any platform be it Windows, Linux, or macOS which
                    means if we compile a program on Windows, then we can run it on Linux
                    and vice versa. Each operating system has a different JVM, but the
                    output produced by all the OS is the same after the execution of
                    bytecode. That is why we call java a platform-independent language.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Object-Oriented Programming Language:Organizing the program in
                    the terms of collection of objects is a way of object-oriented
                    programming, each of which represents an instance of the class.
                    <p>The four main concepts of Object-Oriented programming are:</p>
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Abstraction</li>
                    <li>Encapsulation</li>
                    <li>Inheritance</li>
                    <li>Polymorphism</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    imple:Java is one of the simple languages as it does not have
                    complex features like pointers, operator overloading, multiple
                    inheritances, and Explicit memory allocation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Robust:Java language is robust which means reliable. It is
                    developed in such a way that it puts a lot of effort into checking
                    errors as early as possible, that is why the java compiler is able to
                    detect even those errors that are not easy to detect by another
                    programming language. The main features of java that make it robust
                    are garbage collection, Exception Handling, and memory allocation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Secure:In java, we don't have pointers, so we cannot access
                    out-of-bound arrays i.e it shows ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception if we
                    try to do so. That's why several security flaws like stack corruption
                    or buffer overflow are impossible to exploit in Java. Also java
                    programs run in an environment that is independent of the os(operating
                    system) environment which makes java programs more secure .
                </li>
                <li>
                    Distributed:We can create distributed applications using the
                    java programming language. Remote Method Invocation and Enterprise
                    Java Beans are used for creating distributed applications in java. The
                    java programs can be easily distributed on one or more systems that
                    are connected to each other through an internet connection.Everything in java , is represented in
                    Class as an object including the main function.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Multithreading:Java supports multithreading. It is a Java
                    feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a
                    program for maximum utilization of the CPU.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Portable:As we know, java code written on one machine can be
                    run on another machine. The platform-independent feature of java in
                    which its platform-independent bytecode can be taken to any platform
                    for execution makes java portable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    High Performance:Java architecture is defined in such a way
                    that it reduces overhead during the runtime and at some time java uses
                    Just In Time (JIT) compiler where the compiler compiles code on-demand
                    basics where it only compiles those methods that are called making
                    applications to execute faster.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dynamic flexibility:Java being completely object-oriented gives
                    us the flexibility to add classes, new methods to existing classes and
                    even create new classes through sub-classes. Java even supports
                    functions written in other languages such as C, C++ which are referred
                    to as native methods.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sandbox Execution:Java programs run in a separate space that
                    allows user to execute their applications without affecting the
                    underlying system with help of a bytecode verifier. Bytecode verifier
                    also provides additional security as its role is to check the code for
                    any violation of access.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Write Once Run Anywhere:As discussed above java application
                    generates a '.class' file which corresponds to our
                    applications(program) but contains code in binary format. It provides
                    ease t architecture-neutral ease as bytecode is not dependent on any
                    machine architecture. It is the primary reason java is used in the
                    enterprising IT industry globally worldwide.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Power of compilation and interpretation:Most languages are
                    designed with purpose either they are compiled language or they are
                    interpreted language. But java integrates arising enormous power as
                    Java compiler compiles the source code to bytecode and JVM executes
                    this bytecode to machine OS-dependent executable code.
                </li>

                    class:The class contains the data and methods to be used in the program. Methods define
                    the
                    behavior of the class. Class GFG has only one method Main in JAVA.

                    static void Main():static keyword tells us that this method is accessible without
                    instantiating the
                    class. </li>
                <li>void:keywords tell that this method will not return anything. The main() method is the
                    entry point
                    of our application.</li>
                <li> System.out:This is the standard output stream that is used to produce the result of a
                    program on
                    an output device like the computer screen.</li>
                <li>println():This method in Java is also used to display text on the console. It prints the
                    text on
                    the console and the cursor moves to the start of the next line at the console. The next printing
                    takes place
                    from the next line.</li>
                <li> String []args:This method in Java is also used to display text on the console. It prints
                    the text
                    on
                    the console and the cursor moves to the start of the next line at the console. The next printing
                    takes place
                    from the next line.</li>
