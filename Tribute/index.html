        <small id="caption">Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of
            the greatest
            and most influential physicists of all time.

        <h2>Here is some information about Einstein's life:</h2>

        <div id="">
            <ul>
                <li>Albert Einstein was born in Germany, but lived in Italy, Switzerland and Czechia (which was then
                    part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), until he eventually moved to the United States in 1933.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>When Albert was a boy, he fell in love with physics when his father gifted him a compass.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Albert hated the strict discipline of the grammar school he attended as a teenager, and left aged
                    15, but he still managed to write his first scholarly paper at just 16 years old!
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Rather than becoming a physicist straight away, Albert first trained as a teacher.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>After failing to find work as a maths and physics teacher, Albert decided to obtain a Ph.D. in
                    physics.</li>
                <br>
                <li>One of the discoveries Albert announced in 1905 was his famous formula: E=mc2
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>The formula formed part of Albert's 'General theory of relativity', which he worked on over the next
                    ten years.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Albert's theory of relativity helped scientists understand how the universe works.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>He went on to win The Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his services to theoretical physics, and
                    especially
                    for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of
                    quantum theory.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>He lived in Switzerland between 1895 and 1914, except for one year in Prague, and he received his
                    academic diploma from the Swiss federal polytechnic school (later the Eidgenössische Technische
                    Hochschule, ETH) in Zürich in 1900. He taught theoretical physics there between 1912 and 1914 before
                    he left for Berlin.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Einstein published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works. His
                    intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".
                </li>
